I am currently a Ph.D. candidate advised by Prof. Alexandre Alahi at EPFL, Switzerland. Before that, I received my masterâ€™s degree in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH Zurich and my bachelorâ€™s degree from Wuhan University.

During my master studies, I worked on human-robot handover at the VIT Lab at ETH Zurich with Prof. Otmar Hilliges. Prior to that, I was engaged in applying generative models to traffic simulation with Prof. Bolei Zhou from UCLA.

My research interests focus on applying data-centric techniques to LLMs, robotics, and computer vision to improve performance with less computational resources.
