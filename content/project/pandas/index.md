Indoor localization and navigation are useful for users to find their way in complex buildings. In this project, we present an Hololens application to support indoor floorplan localization and navigation. We design a frontend interface that displays the floorplan minimap, showing the current location, and navigating users to the user-defined destination. There is a backend server that receives images to locate the current pose and solves the navigation problem based on the user-defined destination. The proposed approach has been tested on the large-scale dataset of ETH buildings and shows good performance.
